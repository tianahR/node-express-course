1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.

   Middleware in Express is essentially a series of function calls that get executed 
   in the order they are added. Middleware gets executed after the server receives the request 
   and before the controller actions send the response. Middleware has and access to the request object, 
   responses object, and next, it can process the request before the server sends a response. 
   If a middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, 
   it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function. 
   Otherwise, the request will be left hanging. Middleware functions can be used for various tasks 
   such as logging, authentication, or handling errors.

2. What does CRUD stand for?
   
   CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 
   These are the four basic functions of persistent storage. 
   - Create is used to add a new data, 
   - Read is used to fetch data, 
   - Update is used to modify an existing data, 
   - Delete is used to remove or delete data.

3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
   1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
   
    I can use the dotenv package to load the variables from the .env file into process.env. 
    Using dotenv improve security: All applications use sensitive data like database credentials, 
    API keys, and other secrets that you don't want to expose in your code.
     

   2. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?

   To prevent the .env file from being stored in my Github repository, I add it to my .gitignore file. 
   This tells Git to ignore the file and not to track it.
