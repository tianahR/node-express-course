// 10-fs-sync.js: This should load writeFileSync and readFileSync functions from the fs module. 
// Then you will use writeFileSync to write 3 lines to a file, ./temporary/fileA.txt, 
// using the "append" flag for each line after the first one. Then use readFileSync to read the file, 
// and log the contents to the console. Be sure you create the file in the temporary directory. 
// That will ensure that it isnâ€™t pushed to Github when you submit your answers (because that file has been
//  added to the .gitignore file
//  for you already which tells git not to look at those files).


const { readFileSync, writeFileSync } = require('fs')
// console.log('start')
